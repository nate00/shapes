#Shapes

A simple 2-dimensional game-making framework for Java, designed for Hack 101.

To get started, compile everything and run `MyGame`. You should see an empty window pop up with a blue background. Now open `MyGame.java` in your text editor. This is where you'll be writing code.

To see some example code, open `ExampleGame.java` and `ExampleCircle.java`. You can compile and run `ExampleGame.java` to see how it works. (Use the arrow keys.)
