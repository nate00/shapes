Important:
-Images
-Geometry.distance(Shape, Shape)

Finishing touches:
-make direction, center, etc. consistently private or protected
-commenting, external documentation
-equals(), toString(), other basic methods
-ensure width consistently comes before height (and x before y)
-write @Override annotations
-make naming decisions for accessors [.x() vs .getX()] more consistent

Trivialities:
-ensure partitioning of methods between Geometry and Shape subclasses is consistent

Bugs:
-Make move() and rotate() not always lose gap
-Speech isn't visible when shape goes off the right or top of the screen
-Very fast mouse clicks (between frames) might not work
-Pressing Space + Up + Left doesn't work?
-insertGap() for rotation doesn't work well for large shapes because the gap is in degrees, not pixels. Fixing it is nontrivial because gap insertion must be per possible intersection point, not per rotation.

Wishlist:
-maxMovement is a mess - reorganize
-Music
-BorderBehavior.WRAP
-pushiness
-gravity
