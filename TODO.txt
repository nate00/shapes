ConvexPolygon rotation collision detection!!!!!!!!!

Important:
-Subtitle
-Fail fast
-Make constructors set up default values better.
-Images

Finishing touches:
-make direction, center, etc. consistently private or protected
-commenting, external documentation
-equals(), toString(), other basic methods
-ensure width consistently comes before height (and x before y)
-write @Override annotations

Trivialities:
-make imports consistent (* or not)
-ensure partitioning of methods between Geometry and Shape subclasses is consistent

Bugs:
-Make move() and rotate() not always lose gap
-Solids move through other shapes
-Speech isn't visible when shape goes off the right or top of the screen
-Very fast mouse clicks (between frames) might not work
-Pressing Space + Up + Left doesn't work?
-KeyBindings for Mac?
-insertGap() for rotation doesn't work well for large shapes because the gap is
in degrees, not pixels. Fixing it is nontrivial.

Wishlist:
-maxMovement is a mess - reorganize
-Music
-BorderBehavior.WRAP
-pushiness
-gravity
